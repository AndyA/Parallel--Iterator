Revision history for Parallel-Iterator

0.3.0   2007-10-02
        Made job output and result collection run in sync. Formally job
        output from the master process ran as quickly as possible. This
        results in better scheduling and eliminates the possibility of
        blocking with overlarge data (see t/030-block.t).
        Added support for iterators throwing errors.

0.2.0   2007-09-20
        Renamed Parallel-Iterator. Didn't check Parallel-Workers was
        available. Duh.

0.1.0   2007-09-20
        Initial release.
